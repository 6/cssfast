<h1 class='property-title'>column-fill</h1>
<p class='property-description'>The <code>column-fill</code> CSS property controls how contents are partitioned into columns. Contents are either balanced, which means that contents in all columns will have the same height or, when using <code>auto</code>, just take up the room the content needs.</p>
