description_plain: "The image-rendering CSS property provides a hint to the user agent about how to handle its image rendering.<br> image-rendering applies to scaled images (and other elements, see below). For example, if the natural size of the image is<em> 100×100px </em>but the page author specifies the dimensions to 200×200px (or50×50px), then the image will be upscaled (or downscaled) to the new dimensions using the specified algorithm. Scaling may also apply due to user interaction (zooming)."
