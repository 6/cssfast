name: direction
description: "The <code>direction</code> CSS property should be set to match the direction of the text: <code>rtl</code> for Hebrew or Arabic text and <code>ltr</code> for other scripts. This should normally be done as part of the document (e.g., using the <code>dir</code> attribute in HTML) rather than through direct use of CSS."
