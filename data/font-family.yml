description: "The<code> font-family </code>CSS property allows for a prioritized list of font family names and/or generic family names to be specified for the selected element. Unlike most other CSS properties, values are separated by a comma to indicate that they are alternatives. The browser will select the first font on the list that is installed on the computer, or that can be downloaded using the information provided by a <code><a rel=\"custom\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/@font-face\">@font-face</a></code>\n at-rule."
