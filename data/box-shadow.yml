description: "The <code>box-shadow</code> CSS property accepts one or more shadow effects as a comma-separated list. It allows casting a drop shadow from the frame of almost any element. If a <code>border-radius</code>\n is specified on the element with a box shadow, the box shadow takes on the same rounded corners. The z-ordering of multiple box shadows is the same as multiple text shadows (the first specified shadow is on top)."
